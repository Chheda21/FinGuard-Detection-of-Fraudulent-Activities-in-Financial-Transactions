# FinGuard: Detection of Fraudulent Activities in Financial Transactions

FinGuard is a machine learning-based system designed to detect fraudulent activities within financial transaction data. The project leverages various classification algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to accurately identify suspicious behavior and prevent financial loss.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using historical financial data. Techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and supervised machine learning models were employed to uncover key fraud patterns and enhance prediction performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used is available on Kaggle:  
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Models Used

- XGBoost  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was trained and evaluated using standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  


## ðŸ“ˆ Key Highlights

- Built an end-to-end fraud classification pipeline on millions of transaction records  
- Applied advanced feature scaling and transformation techniques  
- Achieved 99.8% accuracy using XGBoost after iterative hyperparameter tuning  
- Visualized fraud patterns to support business risk analysis and model transparency
